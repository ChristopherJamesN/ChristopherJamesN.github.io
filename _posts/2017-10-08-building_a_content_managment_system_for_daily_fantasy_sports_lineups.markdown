I wanted to have a way to easily create and share daily fantasy sports lineups with my friends, so I created a web application using the Ruby framework Sinatra in order to do just that.

The application employs a model view controller framework, that allows the user to create a new account, sign in, and create, edit and delete fanatsy football lineups.

Users can also view all the lineups that other user have created, however, they will not be able to edit or delete lineups that they have not created themselves.
